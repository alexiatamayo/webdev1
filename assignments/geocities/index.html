            <p>I was a 1D fan since middle and got to see Harry Styles in concert in September. This was actually my second time seeing him. The concert was a blast! This picture is from the concert while he's performing "Sign of the Times." FYI I didnt even have tickets for the concert lol. My sister and I showed up to United Center at around 9 am and waited in line at the box office to buy tickets for 6 HOURS! At like around 4 pm they sold us the tickets. What an advanture:)
