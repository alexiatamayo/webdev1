        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>I like all types of music to be completely honest. Some of my favorite artists include BTS, Dua Lipa, Harry Style, Selena Gomez, Conan Gray, and many more. One of my favorite things to do is attend concerts. I think concerts are an awesome experience because you get to listen to your favorite artist and meet new people with similar interests as you.

        <h3>Travel</h3>
        <p>Traveling is so much fun but super stressful. Some of the places I've visited have been New York City, Texas, Tennesee, Wisconsin, and many other states. My extended family lives in Mexico, and I visit them very often. Since the pandemic started, my parents, siblings, and I have practically lived in Mexico. Since we all do school or work online, we are taking this opportunity to stay in Mexico and enjoy spending time with family.

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>If you know me you know I have a weird obsession with cameras. I got into photography my sophomore year in high school but started practicing it my junior year when I worked in my school's yearbook. I bought my first camera that year which was a canon t6i and loved it. Then I bought a Sony portable camera and then transitioned to film cameras which is what I use now.
